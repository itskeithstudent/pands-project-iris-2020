# pands-project-iris-2020
An analysis of the famous Iris Dataset for Programming and Scripting 52167 taught at GMIT
This repository is to act as a way of describing the Iris dataset by the analysis performed in the .py files contained and the conclusions made.

## Structure for analysis
The analysis will be most likely carried out over a few steps.
We will first need to retrieve the dataset in question, for this project I got the dataset from Kaggle (which you can find here: https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset/data). You can also find the IRIS.csv file which contains all the data in this repository in the iris-flower-dataset directory.
````
Please note: you can get the iris dataset using the sklearn package for python,
but for the purposes of this project I want to include file reading and potentially 
manipulating and outputting the data into one or more other .csv file's.
(...of course this may change as the project progresses, but for the moment this sounds like a good idea to me)
